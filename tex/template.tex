{\huge\myboldfont Unknown Artist}

American, born 199x.

\medskip

{\large{\myboldfont Dennis is a Fagg}, 2018.}

Aerosol paint.

\bigskip

This high-concept installation deftly amplifies the ambient homophobia of low-density urban public space.
The eponymous piece distinguishes itself by its sly realization of exactly what you would expect here.
In an anonymous and brazenly self-aware act of intellectual martyrdom, the artist conspicuously squanders his medium's expressive potential in order to proclaim his own profound creative impotence.
By means of its triviality, this sophisticated work ultimately indicts the middling quality of recreational facilities afforded here by the City of Lansing.

\medskip

{\myitalicfont Dennis is a Fagg} succeeds the Lansing River Trail's acclaimed {\myitalicfont Ass Juice} installation.
